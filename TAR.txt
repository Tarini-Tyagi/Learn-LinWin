File Compression with 'tar'command

 Compress a folder
 
This creates a simple archive of a folder :
tar -cf ./my-archive.tar ./my-folder/
Verbose output shows which files and directories are added to the archive, use the -v option:
tar -cvf ./my-archive.tar ./my-folder/
For archiving a folder compressed 'gzip', you have to use the -z option :
tar -czf ./my-archive.tar.gz ./my-folder/
You can instead compress the archive with 'bzip2', by using the -j option:
tar -cjf ./my-archive.tar.bz2 ./my-folder/
Or compress with 'xz', by using the -J option:
tar -cJf ./my-archive.tar.xz ./my-folder/

 Extract a folder from an archive
There is an example for extract a folder from an archive in the current location :
tar -xf archive-name.tar
If you want to extract a folder from an archive to a specfic destination :
tar -xf archive-name.tar -C ./directory/destination

List contents of an archive
tar -tf archive.tar.gz
