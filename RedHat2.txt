Stratis Storage:

2 to power 24 -- fileSystem can be created from 1 pool
1 device can be used for 1 pool only
2 to power 24 of FileSystem from pool [Any no. of devices can be add to pool]
2 pools can't have same HD attached
File system [semi virtual device/ virtual HD] is like virtual Storage

By default create FileSystem of xfs type  [No need to mount]

Attach 3 or 4 virtual hd -- can be done on vmware

#stratis pool [double tab]
#stratis pool list
#stratis pool create poolexam /dev/vda /dev/vdb
#stratis pool list
poolexam-- name of pool
# stratis blockdev list
now pool created , create filesystem
#stratis filesystem create poolexam exam 
exam---name of filesystem
create exam from pool named poolexam
#stratis filesystem list
+++++the use shown here is not exact [we haven't use anything]
+++++use can be seen from
#mkdir /mnt/stratis
#mount /stratis/poolexam/exam  /mnt/stratis
#df -hT
Size 1TB is the max size of stratis
[In 1 pool stratis can have a max size of 1TB]
[if our device storage is of 10 gb then on inserting data more than that will cause system to
go in maintainance mode]
[if we keep data more than our device storage than it will let us store, but in real-time it will
only store metadata and will not allow our system to be up after reboot
stratis will stop reading data from pool and go in maintainace mode]

#stratis stratis filesystem create poolexam filesystem1
#stratis filesystem list
#mkdir /mnt/fs2
#mount /stratis/poolexam/filesystem1  /mnt/fs2
#df -hT

[Similarly 2 to power 24 can be created]
#fdisk -l
#stratis pool add-data poolexam /dev/vdc 
add stroage in existing pool
#stratis pool list

#stratis pool add-data poolexam /dev/vdd 
add stroage in existing pool
#stratis pool list

how to remove single attached hd from this pool
++Not persistant till now++
in fstab we have to mention service
so that after stratis got started then system has to mount
