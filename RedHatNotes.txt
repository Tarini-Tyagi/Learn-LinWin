2 tasks in downloading-- out of which you want 1 to perform better
nice--- when we are starting process we tell it that you have to perform good irrespective of what os says

-20(high per) to +19(low)
o =neutral
10 low but not very very low
-11 high but not much

# ps -l  ----to see nice for process currently running process by system
# ps -xl
# vim &-----to send process in backend
# ps -xl | grep vim

For doing nice:
#nice -n -10 vim &
# ps -xl | grep vim


Renice---- for already running task
#renice -n 10 processid
[we get processid from the output of ps -xl | grep vim]
#renice -n 10 6932
# ps -xl | grep vim

/////# ps -o pid,pcpu,nice,comm --sort=pcpu
#ps -aux --sort=pcpu  --show cpu usage of process
process consuming most cpu - renice it
