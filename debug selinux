CHANGING PORT NUMBERS

Depending on policy configuration, services may only be allowed to run on certain port numbers.
Attempting to change the port a service runs on without changing policy may result in the service failing to start.
Run the semanage port -l | grep -w "http_port_t" command as the root user to list the ports SELinux allows httpd to listen on:

# semanage port -l | grep -w http_port_t
http_port_t                    tcp      80, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443

By default, SELinux allows http to listen on TCP ports 80, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, or 8443.
If /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf is configured so that httpd listens on any port not listed for http_port_t, httpd fails to start.

To configure httpd to run on a port other than TCP ports 80, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, or 8443:

Edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf as the root user so the Listen option lists a port that is not configured in SELinux policy for httpd.
The following example configures httpd to listen on the 10.0.0.1 IP address, and on TCP port 12345:
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses (0.0.0.0)
#
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen 10.0.0.1:12345

Run the semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 12345 command as the root user to add the port to SELinux policy configuration.
Run the semanage port -l | grep -w http_port_t command as the root user to confirm the port is added:

# semanage port -l | grep -w http_port_t
http_port_t                    tcp      12345, 80, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443
If you no longer run httpd on port 12345, run the semanage port -d -t http_port_t -p tcp 12345 command as the root user to remove
the port from policy configuration.
