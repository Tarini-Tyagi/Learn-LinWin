1) Create Partition
fdisk -l    show no. of HD attached to linux
 fdisk -l /dev/xvdf
 fdisk  /dev/xvdf           to go inside HD
smallest unit of HD-Sector
Size of 1 sector == 512byte 
new or n----p for primary (p is suboption of n so dont clash with print)
For 1st partition press enter (for default)
On extended----- 1st sector pe enter  and 2nd pe bhi enter
                       if we'll give size then remaining will be waste

*****Never ever delete or format extended *****
all the logical will also get deleted

2) format that partition -- NTFS-windows(HFS+ for mac, XFS for RedHat)  (format==setting up environment)
 On formatting index is getting deleted not the data
If PD is being formated by any of these than your os will not detect it
new PD is being formated by FAT or vFAT --- accepted by all os window , mac etc

#mkfs.xfs     /dev/xvdf1   to format

#mkfs. +2times tab ===FAT option not available for amazon cloud it knows we cant attach 
out pd
3) mount- linking a partition with a folder
on connecting Pd , it creates a folder(/tmp/newVol) link it with /dev/xvdf  and folder shown on desktop

to check the folder to which partition is linked
#df
create a folder and map/link it with partition

root,home,etc,tmp/dev/mnt,media
#mkdir /mnt/mypart
#mount /dev/xvdf  /mnt/mypart
#echo $?
Mounting can be done only after formatting
#df (disk free) -- to see where we have mount
# df -h (human readable format)
#df -hT (t for format type)

media -- icon will be created(if folder is created in media to mount)
mnt-- icon will not be created 

if system is restart than mapping will be removed (link will be removed--data will be there)
you have to link it again or make permanent
/etc/ftab    file system tabbing
where we make mounting permanent in HD
mount -a --- to cross check the entry in file
